\section{Double Metaphone -- Phonetic string matching}

The library \pllib{double_metaphone} implements the \emph{Double
Metaphone} algorithm developed by Lawrence Philips and described in
``The Double-Metaphone Search Algorithm'' by L Philips, C/C++ Userâ€™s
Journal, 2000. Double Metaphone creates a key from a word that
represents its phonetic properties. Two words with the same Double
Metaphone are supposed to sound similar. The Double Metaphone algorithm
is an improved version of the \emph{Soundex} algorithm.

\begin{description}
    \predicate{double_metaphone}{2}{+In, -MetaPhone}
Same as double_metaphone/3, but only returning the primary metaphone.
    \predicate{double_metaphone}{3}{+In, -MetaPhone, -AltMetaphone}
Create metaphone and alternative metaphone from \arg{In}.  The primary
metaphone is based on english, while the secondary deals with common
alternative pronounciation in other languages.  \arg{In} is either
and atom, string object, code- or character list.  The metaphones
are always returned as atoms.
\end{description}


\subsection{Origin and Copyright}

The Double Metaphone algorithm is copied from the Perl library that
holds the following copyright notice.  To the best of our knowledge
the Perl license is compatible to the SWI-Prolog license schema and
therefore including this module poses no additional license conditions.

\begin{quote}

All rights reserved.

This code is based heavily on the C++ implementation by Lawrence Philips
and incorporates several bug fixes courtesy of Kevin Atkinson
<kevina@users.sourceforge.net>.

This module is free software; you may redistribute it and/or modify it
under the same terms as Perl itself.

\section{Porter Stem -- Determine stem and related routines}

The \pllib{porter_stem} library implements the stemming algorithm
described by Porter in Porter, 1980, ``An algorithm for suffix
stripping'', Program, Vol. 14, no. 3, pp 130-137. The library comes with
some additional predicates that are commonly used in the context of
stemming.

\begin{description}
    \predicate{porter_stem}{2}{+In, -Stem}
Determine the stem of \arg{In}.  \arg{In} must represent ASCII text.
The predicate unaccent_atom/2 may be used to remove accents from
ISO Latin-1 text.  \arg{Stem} is unified with the resulting stem
in lowercase.

    \predicate{unaccent_atom}{2}{+In, -ASCII}
If in is general ISO Latin-1 text with accents, \arg{ASCII} is unified
with a plain ASCII version of the string. This predicate should be used
before porter_stem/2 if the input may contain accents.

    \predicate{tokenize_atom}{2}{+In, -TokenList}
Break the text \arg{In} into words, numbers and punctuation characters.

    \predicate{atom_to_stem_list}{2}{+In, -ListOfStems}
Combines the three above routines, returning a list holding an atom
with the stem of each word encountered and numbers for encountered
numbers.
\end{description}


\section{Installation}

\subsection{Unix systems}

Installation on Unix system uses the commonly found {\em configure},
{\em make} and {\em make install} sequence. SWI-Prolog should be
installed before building this package. If SWI-Prolog is not installed
as \program{pl}, the environment variable \env{PL} must be set to the
name of the SWI-Prolog executable. Installation is now accomplished
using:

\begin{code}
% ./configure
% make
% make install
\end{code}

This installs the foreign libraries in \file{$PLBASE/lib/$PLARCH} and
the Prolog library files in \file{$PLBASE/library}, where
\file{$PLBASE} refers to the SWI-Prolog `home-directory'.
